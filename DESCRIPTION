Description: Provides step-by-step automation for integrating biodiversity data from multiple online aggregators, merging and cleaning datasets while addressing challenges such as taxonomic inconsistencies, georeferencing issues, and spatial or environmental outliers. Includes functions to extract environmental data and to define the biogeographic ranges in which species are most likely to occur.
